/*
### **Understanding `__proto__` and `prototype` in JavaScript**  

In JavaScript, **`__proto__`** and **`prototype`** are key concepts related to object inheritance. They are often confused, but they serve different purposes.

---

## **1. `__proto__` (Dunder Proto)**
‚úÖ **What is it?**  
- `__proto__` is an **internal reference** to the prototype of an object.  
- It connects an object to the prototype of its constructor function.  

‚úÖ **Purpose:**  
- Allows objects to inherit properties and methods from their prototype chain.  

‚úÖ **Example:**
```javascript
const person = { name: "Alice" };
console.log(person.__proto__); // Logs the prototype object (in this case, Object.prototype)
```

‚úÖ **Key Points:**
- Every JavaScript object has a `__proto__` that points to its prototype.
- It is **not recommended** to use `__proto__` directly (use `Object.getPrototypeOf()` instead).

---

## **2. `prototype`**
‚úÖ **What is it?**  
- `prototype` is a **property of constructor functions**.  
- It is an object that contains methods and properties that will be inherited by instances created from the constructor.  

‚úÖ **Purpose:**  
- Used to define methods and properties that will be shared across all instances of a constructor function.  

‚úÖ **Example:**
```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function () {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
};

const alice = new Person("Alice");
alice.greet(); // "Hello, Alice"

console.log(alice.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // true
```

‚úÖ **Key Points:**
- `prototype` is a property of **functions (constructor functions)**.
- Objects created using `new` will have their `__proto__` pointing to the constructor‚Äôs `prototype`.
- Changes to `prototype` affect all instances.

---

## **üîç `__proto__` vs `prototype` ‚Äì Key Differences**
| Feature      | `__proto__` | `prototype` |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| Belongs to  | Objects (instances) | Constructor functions |
| Type        | Object | Object |
| Usage       | Points to the prototype of an object | Used to define shared methods for all instances |
| Modification | Not recommended | Preferred for defining shared properties and methods |

---

## **üöÄ Quick Analogy**
- Think of `prototype` as **a blueprint for houses**.  
- `__proto__` is the **actual connection of a house to that blueprint**.
